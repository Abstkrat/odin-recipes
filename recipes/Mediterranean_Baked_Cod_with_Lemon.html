		<h2>Simple Whole Wheat Bread</h2>
		<p>
			A great-tasting whole wheat bread recipe,
			easy to make with simple ingredients.
		</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>3 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
			<li>2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast</li>
			<li>â…” cup honey, divided</li>
			<li>5 cups breaad flour</li>
			<li>5 tablespoons butter, melted, divided</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
			<li>4 cups whole wheat flour, or more as needed</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
			<li>Mix warm water, yeast, and 1/3
				cup honey in a large bowl to dissolve. </li>
			<li>Add 5 cups bread flour, and stir to combine. </li>
			<li>Let sit for 30 minutes, or until big and bubbly.</li>
			<li>Mix in 3 tablespoons melted butter, remaining 1/3 cup
				honey, and salt. Stir in 2 cups whole wheat flour.</li>
			<li> Transfer dough to a floured work surface and gradually
				knead in remaining 2 cups whole wheat flour.</li>
			<li> Knead until dough starts to pull away from the work
				surface, adding more whole wheat flour if necessary;
				dough should be a bit tacky to the touch, but not too sticky.</li>
			<li>Place in a greased bowl, turning once to coat the surface of the dough.</li>
			<li>Cover with a dish towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled, 45 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
			<li>Grease three 9x5-inch loaf pans. Punch down the dough, and divide it into 3 loaves. </li>
			<li> Place in the prepared loaf pans, and allow to rise until dough has topped
				the pans by one inch, another 45 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
			<li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake the risen
				loaves in the preheated oven until golden brown for 25 to 30 minutes, do not overbake. </li>
			<li> Lightly brush the tops of the loaves with remaining 2 tablespoons
				melted butter when done to prevent crust from getting hard.</li>
			<li>Cool completely. Enjoy!</li>
