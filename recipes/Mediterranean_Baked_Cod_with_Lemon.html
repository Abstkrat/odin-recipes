    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon finely minced fresh garlic</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley</li>
			<li>2 teaspoons minced fresh oregano</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme or rosemary</li>
			<li>1/2 teaspoon finely ground pink salt, or to tast</li>
			<li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
      <li>4 (6 ounce) cod filets</li>
      <li>2 lemons, each cut into 8 thin slices</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>4 sprigs fresh parsley for garnish (optional)</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). </li>
      <li>Place softened butter, minced garlic, parsley, oregano, and thyme or rosemary on a cutting board. Using a sharp knife, cut herbs and garlic into each other and the butter, cutting and mixing as you go. Add pink salt, black pepper, and paprika, and mix until well blended. </li>
      <li>Pat cod filets dry. In a 12x18-inch casserole or baking pan, place each filet on top of 2 lemon slices. Evenly divide herb butter mixture among the filets; use a fork or offset spatula to spread herb butter over filets. Top each filet with 2 remaining lemon slices. </li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cod flakes easily with a fork, 13 to 15 minutes. See note. </li>
      <li>To serve, drizzle each filet with extra virgin olive oil, and garnish with fresh parsley, if desired. </li>
